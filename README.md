# 🫁 AI Lung Disease Detection System

![Project Banner](assets/banner.png)

An AI-powered system that analyzes **lung sound recordings** and predicts respiratory conditions using **Deep Learning** and **audio signal processing**.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist healthcare by identifying abnormal respiratory sounds such as **crackles and wheezes** from audio recordings.

---

#  Project Overview

Respiratory diseases require early diagnosis for effective treatment. Lung sound recordings contain patterns that can indicate abnormalities.

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify lung sound recordings and predict possible respiratory conditions.

Main components of the system:

• Audio preprocessing pipeline
• Feature extraction from lung sounds
• CNN model for classification
• Backend API for predictions
• Web interface for audio upload and results

#  System Architecture

![System Architecture](assets/SystemArchitecture.png)

The system processes lung sound recordings through multiple stages:

1. Audio upload from the user interface
2. Audio preprocessing and noise handling
3. Feature extraction using MFCCs
4. CNN model prediction
5. Display predicted respiratory condition

---

#  Application Demo

## Web Interface

![Application Screenshot 1](assets/ui.png)

Users can upload respiratory sound recordings through a simple web interface.

---

## Upload & Processing

![Application Screenshot 2](assets/analyze.png)

The audio file is sent to the backend where preprocessing and feature extraction are performed.

---

## Prediction Result
